# Level up with constraints
Using a deck of constraint cards, a 2013 Kickstarter project to improve your web development skills, we will build a website.

Each card in the deck has a constraint on it that will limit the things we can use or do whilst building the site.

## Mooncheese
Finally the time has arrived, it is now 2021 and commercial space flight is getting more and more accesible for the general public. Trips around Earth are a getting populair as day activities and as school trips.

There is now a well established settlement in Mars and the Chinese have been mining lunar regolith for four years now.

### Moontrips
Starting this summer, the company "MoonCheese" offers for the first time ever trips to the moon!

If you book, you will get an all inclusive holiday on the moon for 4 days! You will travel to and from the moon by the luxurious first-class space-liner "Europhia" which takes you from the spaceport "Cape Drienerlo" too the moon in about 6 hours.

### Website
MoonCheese needs a website where all information can be found and where trips can be booked.

## Constraints
During the meetup we will work with constraint cards. Each team will get a **first card** after 30 minutes and a **second card** after one hour.

At the end, each team presents their results and experiences!
